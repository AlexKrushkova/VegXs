Welcome to VegExcess where vegetable producers/local farmers can post their excessive produce for the general public to contact them and buy. 
You would be able to log in/ register/ sign up.

The logged in user has the option to create a produce offer with details, edit it and delete it.
The not logged-in user can only see details of the offer and contact the owner.

I am using Firebase as a database and will be using firebase hosting as soon as my project is finished.
